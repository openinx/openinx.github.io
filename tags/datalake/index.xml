      <description>This is the second article of my thoughts for Iceberg Summit 2025 (Here is Part-1), which is not limited to Iceberg but focuses on Data Lake. I am trying to share what these creative teams are doing in this field, why it is a problem, what the solution is, and how it will develop in the future. These insights come from various sharing, discussions, and debates, but are limited by my personal understanding.</description>

      <description>I attended the Apache Iceberg Summit 2025 in the US in the past two days. The conference was held at the Hyatt Regency Hotel next to Union Square in downtown San Francisco. This time, two floors of the hotel were rented as the venue. Mainstream companies in the Data field are basically sponsors of the conference, including AWS, Databricks, Snowflake, Cloudera, Dremio, Microsoft, Airbyte, CelerData, Confluent, eltloop, Google, IMB, Minio, Qlik, Redpanda, Starburst, StreamNative, e6data, daft, PuppyGraph, RisingWave, Telmai, wherobots.</description>
