      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been working at a US company for almost a month recently. An interesting fact is that I have counted the SaaS services I have used for specific scenarios since joining, and surprisingly, there are as many as 23 of them. All of these SaaS services are provided by third-party companies. In other words, Databricks is a customer of all these companies. This aroused my curiosity and made me want to learn about the situation of these companies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
